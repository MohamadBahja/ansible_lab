This lab focuses on using an SCM tool like Ansible to automate system configurations, such as firewall rules, Docker deployment, user management, and service setup (e.g., Apache, NTP, WordPress). The tasks involve following best practices, ensuring idempotence, and securely handling sensitive data. The project includes light and advanced scenarios to practice system automation, with configurations stored in organized files like inventory, roles, and playbooks. The goal is to automate infrastructure management while following industry standards for configuration management.
